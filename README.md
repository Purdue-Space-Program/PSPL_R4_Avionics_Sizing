### Making Changes
- If you estimate a change will not take you more than one day, it is okay to edit the code without making a new branch
  Just make sure that people are aware of this and push your changes when you finish
  
- If you are planning a significant, multi-day project, it is best to create a new branch then merge it in later.
  The branch name should be a short overview of what you plan to do. Send a message in channel before merging so
  everyone is aware of large changes. 
  
- If you are creating new scripts, place them in a folder that has a descriptive name. This is so that if
  a project needs multiple code files, they can still stay organized.

- **Check the files you have modified before making a commit**. If you see a change to a file
  that you don't remember making, please check it and do not commit it if it was unintentional
